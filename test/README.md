# Testing

Automated checks cover ShellCheck/`bash -n` and Bats tests running in an isolated Docker container for safety.

## How to run

* [`./lint.sh`](lint.sh) - **Lint only** - ShellCheck + `bash -n`
* [`./run-tests.sh`](run-tests.sh) - **Lint + Bats** - builds the image from [`docker/Dockerfile`](docker/Dockerfile), then runs the Bats tests in the container.
* CI also runs these via [.github/workflows/lint.yml](../.github/workflows/lint.yml) and [.github/workflows/test.yml](../.github/workflows/test.yml).

```bash
./test/run-tests.sh
```

[`bats-core`](https://github.com/bats-core/bats-core) tests in [`docker/*.bats`](docker/) cover **build-fixture** regressions, **wizard** behaviour for `./configure.sh`, and **commands** helpers under **`builds/system/`**. The image **copies the repo at build time** (no host bind mount). [`docker/run-bats.sh`](docker/run-bats.sh) runs each suite file in its own **`bats` process** (builder, then wizard, then commands) and re-copies harness **`wsl-builds.conf`** between them.

* **Do not** run [`docker/run-bats.sh`](docker/run-bats.sh) on the host — it overwrites repo-root **`wsl-builds.conf`**.
* **Docker harness files:** [`docker/`](docker/) - contains the Docker image and all the files necesary to run the Bats tests in an isolated container.

Before changing `build.sh`, `src/install-dispatch.sh`, shared helpers under `src/`, `configure.sh`, or Bats tests, skim this doc and run **`./test/run-tests.sh`** when behaviour may regress.

## Bats catalog (`docker/builder-tests.bats`)

Each row is one `@test`. The **`#`** column is the stable **B**… id (same order as TAP **`ok N …`** for **N** = **1–26** in this file). Tests use an isolated `$HOME` and harness `wsl-builds.conf`.

| # | Test | What it checks |
| -: | ---- | ---------------- |
| B1 | `build.sh with no arguments exits nonzero and prints usage` | No args → failure, usage line, “available build directories” line. |
| B2 | `unknown build directory exits nonzero` | Fake build dir → error and nonzero exit. |
| B3 | `single-arg test-fixture lists components without running install pipeline` | Only `test-fixture` → usage + component list, no successful install. |
| B4 | `noop component noop-hyphen runs full harness and succeeds` | Full path for `noop-hyphen` → success, banner, `installed!`. |
| B5 | `comma-separated noop-hyphen (hyphen token) and noop (plain token) dispatch` | CSV `noop,noop-hyphen` runs both tokens and succeeds. |
| B6 | `invalid component for test-fixture fails` | Unknown component → invalid component error. |
| B7 | `--force with noop-hyphen succeeds` | `--force` accepted after component list. |
| B8 | `successful install writes ~/.wsl-build.info with OS header and component line` | First-line OS-style header (has whitespace), ≥2 lines, exact component record line. |
| B9 | `comma-separated installs append one record line per component` | Two components → two distinct lines in build.info, each once. |
| B10 | `second install without --force skips and does not duplicate build.info lines` | Re-run same component → skip warnings, “No changes made”, single record line. |
| B11 | `--force reinstall appends another identical component line to build.info` | Second run with `--force` → duplicate identical component line (count 2). |
| B12 | `touch-marker writes sentinel file and records success in build.info` | Component touches marker under `$HOME` and logs success line. |
| B13 | `usage output lists test-fixture among available build directories` | Usage listing includes `test-fixture` under available dirs. |
| B14 | `too many arguments exits nonzero` | Extra positional arg after component → “too many arguments”. |
| B15 | `comma-separated valid then invalid component fails` | `noop,<bad>` fails validation after seeing valid prefix. |
| B16 | `--force alone without component fails validation` | `test-fixture --force` invalid — `$2` must be a component. |
| B17 | `empty component argument fails validation` | Empty second arg treated as invalid component. |
| B18 | `component match is case-insensitive; build.info keeps canonical token` | `NOOP-HYPHEN` installs; record uses lowercase hyphen form from metadata. |
| B19 | `failed validation leaves ~/.wsl-build.info absent` | Unknown build dir then invalid component — still no build.info under fake `$HOME`. |
| B20 | `multiple installs reuse single OS header line in build.info` | Sequential `noop` then `touch-marker` → two component lines, one non-component line (OS header). |
| B21 | `WSL_BUILDS_CONF set to readable file is sourced and path is printed` | `WSL_BUILDS_CONF` points at a copy of the harness file → build succeeds; output names that path. |
| B22 | `WSL_BUILDS_CONF set but not readable exits nonzero` | Missing path → nonzero exit; output reports unreadable `WSL_BUILDS_CONF`. |
| B23 | `getfile-harness exercises getFile cache hit download cleanupGetFiles and records success` | Runs harness component → success; stdout shows cache-hit and download paths (`wget` via short-lived localhost HTTP server); `~/.wsl-build.info` records `getfile-harness`. |
| B24 | `file-edit-harness updates shell rc and /etc/wsl.conf` | Seeds dummy `/etc/wsl.conf`, runs harness component, asserts `ensureShellRcRegion` block in `~/.bashrc` and `ensureWslConfIniLine` under `[wsl-builds-test]`; restores `/etc/wsl.conf` after. |
| B25 | `getfile-stale-harness stale cache default yes keeps seeded payload` | `WARN_IF_CACHED_FILE_OLDER_THAN=1` in harness conf; aged cache + `printf '\n'` → stale warning and “Using locally cached version”; payload matches seed; `WSL_BUILDS_GETFILE_STALE_EXPECT=cache`. |
| B26 | `getfile-stale-harness stale cache n refreshes from fixture URL` | Same aged cache; `printf 'n\n'` → “Downloading fresh copy”; payload matches HTTP fixture; `WSL_BUILDS_GETFILE_STALE_EXPECT=refresh`. |

## Commands catalog (`docker/commands-tests.bats`)

Each row is one `@test`; labels **C**… are stable ids. Tests run with **`WSL_BUILDS_COMMAND_TEST_ROOT`** so scripts read/write seeded files under **`$CMD_ROOT/etc/...`** (no host `/etc` changes).

| # | Test | What it checks |
| -: | ---- | ---------------- |
| C1 | `apt-mirror-switch with no args prints usage and current mirror` | Seeded canonical `ubuntu.sources`; status 0; usage mentions `canonical` / `uni-of-kent`; `Current mirror: canonical`. |
| C2 | `apt-mirror-switch classifies mixed Ubuntu archive URLs` | Mixed URIs → `Current mirror: mixed`. |
| C3 | `apt-mirror-switch switches Kent ubuntu.sources to canonical (root)` | Kent URIs rewritten to archive + security hosts; classifier reports canonical. |
| C4 | `apt-mirror-switch switches canonical ubuntu.sources to uni-of-kent (root)` | Canonical URIs → mirrorservice URLs; classifier reports uni-of-kent. |
| C5 | `apt-mirror-switch rejects unknown mirror` | Exit **2**, `Unknown mirror` in output. |
| C6 | `apt-mirror-switch with too many args fails` | Exit **1**, extra positional rejected. |
| C7 | `change-hostname with no args prints usage and fails` | Exit **1**; `Usage:` in output. |
| C8 | `change-hostname updates wsl.conf and hosts under test root` | Hostname applies under test root **`/etc`**. |

## Wizard catalog (`docker/conf-wizard-tests.bats`)

Wizard tests snapshot repo-root **`wsl-builds.conf`** each test and restore it in `teardown`. [`run-bats.sh`](docker/run-bats.sh) runs this file **after [`builder-tests.bats`](docker/builder-tests.bats)** (and before [`commands-tests.bats`](docker/commands-tests.bats)); the harness **`wsl-builds.conf`** is re-copied before this process so each suite starts clean. Each row is one `@test`. TAP numbers for this file alone are **1–19** (see file order; labels **W**… are stable ids, not TAP order).

| # | Test | What it checks |
| -: | ---- | -------------- |
| W1 | `--help` exits 0 and prints usage | Status 0; output contains `Usage:`. |
| W2 | Unknown option fails | Nonzero; `Unknown option` in output. |
| W3 | `--noninteractive` creates repo `wsl-builds.conf` from example | Linux-only env (no host default): file created; output mentions example. |
| W4 | `--noninteractive` when repo conf exists is no-op | `already exists` message; file checksum unchanged. |
| W5 | Non-TTY stdin auto-forces noninteractive | `./configure.sh </dev/null` copies example when missing (same class as W3). |
| W6 | `--defaults` alias | Same outcome as W3. |
| W7 | No managed shell rc markers after noninteractive without host default | No legacy `(managed)` or `wsl-builds:wsl-builds-conf` in fake `$HOME` `~/.bashrc` / `~/.zshrc` if present. |
| W8 | `removeManagedShellRcRegion` with no `~/.bashrc` | No-op; no error (sourced script). |
| W9 | `removeManagedShellRcRegion` strips named region only | Outside lines survive; inner lines removed. |
| W10 | `removeManagedShellRcRegion` with no markers | File byte-for-byte unchanged. |
| W11 | `replaceManagedShellRcRegion` replace / idempotent | Two calls → one block; final `WSL_BUILDS_CONF` path is the second. |
| W12 | Path quoting in managed block | Path with spaces and `$`; `source ~/.bashrc` exports correct value. |
| W13 | `normalizeHostConfPath` absolute readable | Returns same path. |
| W14 | `normalizeHostConfPath` empty input | Fails. |
| W15 | `normalizeHostConfPath` non-absolute | Fails without `wslpath` success (Linux image). |
| W16 | Pre-seeded legacy managed `~/.bashrc` block stripped on fall-through | `--noninteractive` removes legacy markers; no `wsl-builds:wsl-builds-conf` region added; surrounding lines kept. |
| W17 | Shell hint warns when `WSL_BUILDS_CONF` is set in env | `WSL_BUILDS_CONF=/path … --noninteractive` → `WARN: WSL_BUILDS_CONF still set`. |
| W18 | Shell hint silent when `WSL_BUILDS_CONF` is unset | `--noninteractive` with no env var → no `still set` line. |
| W19 | `replaceManagedShellRcRegion` with bash and zsh | When both rc files exist, each gets exactly one `wsl-builds-conf` block and the same `export`. |
